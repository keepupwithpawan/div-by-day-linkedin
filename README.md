# Div by Day — 30 Days of Frontend UI Challenges

Welcome to **Div by Day**, a 30-day journey where I build and share one frontend UI component or layout every single day using only HTML and CSS (and sometimes a touch of JavaScript).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This series is my way of:

- Sharpening core **HTML/CSS skills**
- Building a habit of **consistency and discipline**
- Learning **better design thinking** through real layouts
- Creating a public, visual portfolio of frontend work
- Staying active and visible while I explore opportunities in frontend development
